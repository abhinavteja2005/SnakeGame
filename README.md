## 🕹️ Controls

* Use **Arrow Keys** (`← ↑ ↓ →`) to change the snake's direction.
* Press **Restart** after game over to play again.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* When the game starts, you are asked to **enter your name** directly in the game window.
* Your **score increases** as you collect food.
* Your score and best score are stored **permanently** in `scores.json`.
* The **Top 5 players** are shown after each game.

---

## ⚙️ Customization

### 🔄 Change Snake Speed

The snake’s speed is controlled by the global variable:

```python
SPEED = 150  # milliseconds between moves
```

* **Lower** this value to make the snake move **faster**.
* **Increase** it to make the game **slower** and easier.

For example:

```python
SPEED = 100  # Faster
SPEED = 200  # Slower
```

> You can find this in the top of `game.py`.

---

## 📝 Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* No external libraries needed (`tkinter` and `json` are built-in)

---

## 🧪 To Run the Game

Make sure all `.py` files are in the same directory.

```bash
python game.py
```

A window will open where you can enter your name and start playing.
